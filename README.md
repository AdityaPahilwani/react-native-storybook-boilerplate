# react-native-storybook-boilerplate

Building a UI library for React Native together with storybook is a good experience, but it's hard to display the components on the web, therefore
I want to transpile the react-native component through the react-native-web project so I can display them easily on the web. 

It's the ultimate library development setup meant for kickstarting ui library development for react-native. 

Goals of this repo:
- setup react native
- setup @storybook/react-native-server for react native UI development
- setup react from scratch
- setup @storybook/react to run as a seperate storybook
- Build static storybook site with react-native-web display of the react-native components.
